# View and manage incidents and alerts in Microsoft Defender multitenant management

Multitenant management for Microsoft Defender XDR and the Microsoft unified security operations platform enables security operation center (SOC) analysts to access and analyze data from multiple tenants in one place, allowing them to quickly identify and respond to threats. Triage incidents and alerts across security information and event management (SIEM) and extended detection and response (XDR) data for tenants that onboarded a Microsoft Sentinel workspace to the unified security operations platform.

Manage incidents & alerts originating from multiple tenants under **Incidents & alerts**.

## View and investigate incidents

To view or investigate an incident: 

1. Go to the [Incidents page](https://mto.security.microsoft.com/incidents) in Microsoft Defender multitenant management. The **Tenant name** column shows which tenant the incident originates from:
