# Predefined classifications

Security Exposure Management provides an out-of-the-box catalog of predefined critical asset classifications for assets that include devices, identities, and cloud resources.

You can [review and classify critical assets](classify-critical-assets.md), turning them on and off as needed.

To suggest new critical asset classifications, use the **Feedback** button.

Current asset types are:

* [Device](#device)
* [Identity](#identity)
* [Cloud resource](#cloud-resource)

> [!Note]
> We also utilize criticality context retrieved from external data connectors. This context will be presented as classifications in the predefined critical asset management classification library.
