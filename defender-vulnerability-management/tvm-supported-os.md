# Supported operating systems, platforms and capabilities

Before you begin, ensure that you meet the operating system and platform requirements for vulnerability management so the activities in your devices are properly accounted for. The supported systems and platforms for vulnerability management may be different from the [Minimum requirements for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/defender-endpoint/minimum-requirements) list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Device vulnerability information is gathered regularly from devices that are onboarded to Defender for Endpoint, in both active mode and passive mode. This capability is available across supported Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.

## Capabilities per supported operating systems (OS) and platforms
