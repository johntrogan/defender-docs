## Overview of behavior monitoring

Behavior monitoring monitors process behavior to detect and analyze potential threats based on the behavior of the applications, daemons, and files within the system. As behavior monitoring observes how the software behaves in real-time, it can adapt quickly to new and evolving threats and block them.

## Prerequisites

- The device must be onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
- [Preview features](/defender-endpoint/preview) must be enabled in the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com).
- The device must be in the [Beta channel](/defender-endpoint/mac-updates) (formerly `InsiderFast`). 
- The minimum Microsoft Defender for Endpoint version number must be Beta (Insiders-Fast): [101.24042.0002](/defender-endpoint/mac-whatsnew#may-2024-build-101240420008---release-version-2012404280) or newer. The version number refers to the `app_version` (also known as **Platform update**).
- Real-time protection (RTP) must be enabled.
- [Cloud-delivered protection](/defender-endpoint/mac-preferences) must be enabled.
- The device must be explicitly enrolled in the preview program.

## Deployment instructions for behavior monitoring

To deploy behavior monitoring in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS, you must change the behavior monitoring policy using one of the following methods:

- [Intune](#intune-deployment)
- [JamF or other non-Microsoft MDM](#jamf-deployment)
- [Manually](#manual-deployment)

The following sections describe each of these methods in detail.

### Intune deployment

For more information, see: [Set preferences for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS](/defender-endpoint/mac-preferences).

#### Manual deployment

You can enable Behavior Monitoring on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS by running the following command from the Terminal:

```bash
sudo mdatp config behavior-monitoring --value enabled
```

To disable:

```bash
sudo mdatp config behavior-monitoring --value disabled
```

For more information, see: [Resources for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS](/defender-endpoint/mac-resources).

### To test behavior monitoring (prevention/block) detection

See [Behavior Monitoring demonstration](demonstration-behavior-monitoring.md).

### Verifying behavior monitoring detections

The existing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS command line interface can be used to review behavior monitoring details and artifacts.

```bash

sudo mdatp threat list

```

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### What if I see an increase in cpu utilization or memory utilization?

Disable behavior monitoring and see if the issue goes away.

- If the issue doesn't go away, it isn't related to behavior monitoring.
- If the issue goes away, download the [XMDE Client Analyzer](https://aka.ms/XMDEClientAnalyzer), and then contact Microsoft support.

## Network real-time inspection for macOS

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

The network real-time inspection (NRI) for macOS feature enhances real-time protection (RTP) by using [behavior monitoring](behavior-monitor-macos.md) in concert with file, process, and other events to detect suspicious activity. Behavior monitoring triggers both telemetry and sample submissions on suspicious files for Microsoft to analyze from the cloud protection backend, and is delivered to the client device, resulting in a removal of the threat.

### Is there an impact on performance?

NRI should have a low impact on network performance. Instead of holding the connection and blocking, NRI makes a copy of the packet as it crosses the network, and NRI performs an asynchronous inspection.

> [!NOTE]
> When network real-time inspection (NRI) for macOS is enabled, you might see a slight increase in memory utilization. 

### Requirements for NRI for macOS

- The device must be onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
- Preview features must be turned on in the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com).
- The device must be in the Beta channel (formerly `InsiderFast`).
- The minimum version number for Defender for Endpoint version number must be Beta (Insiders-Fast): [101.24092.0004](/defender-endpoint/mac-whatsnew#oct-2024-build-101240920004---release-version-2012409240) or newer. The version number refers to the `app version` (also known as Platform update).
- Real-time protection must be enabled.
- Behavior monitoring must be enabled.
- Cloud-delivered protection must be enabled.
- The device must be explicitly enrolled into the preview.

### Deployment instructions for NRI for macOS

1. E-mail us at `NRIonMacOS@microsoft.com` with information about your Microsoft Defender for Endpoint OrgID where you would like to have network real-time inspection (NRI) for macOS enabled. 

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > In order to evaluate NRI for macOS, send email to `NRIonMacOS@microsoft.com`. Include your Defender for Endpoint Org ID. We're enabling this feature on a per-request basis for each tenant.
 
2. Enable behavior monitoring if it's not already enabled:

   ```Bash

   sudo mdatp config behavior-monitoring --value enabled
   
   ```
 
3. Enable network protection in block mode:

   ```Bash

   sudo mdatp config network-protection enforcement-level --value block
   
   ```

1. Enable network real-time inspection (NRI):

      ```Bash
   
   sudo mdatp network-protection remote-settings-override set --value "{\"enableNriMpengineMetadata\" : true}"
   
   
   ```
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > While this feature is in preview, and because the setting is set by using command line, network real-time inspection (NRI) doesn't persist following reboots. You must re-enable it.
