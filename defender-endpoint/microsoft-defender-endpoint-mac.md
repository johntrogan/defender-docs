- [Microsoft Intune-based deployment](mac-install-with-intune.md)
- Non-Microsoft management tools:
    - [JAMF-based deployment](mac-install-with-jamf.md)
    - [Other MDM products](mac-install-with-other-mdm.md)

- 12 (Monterey)

- Supported processors: x64 and ARM64

- Beta versions of macOS aren't supported.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On macOS 11 (Large Sur) and later, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint requires more configuration profiles. If you're an existing customer upgrading from earlier versions of macOS, make sure to deploy the extra configuration profiles listed on [New configuration profiles for macOS Big Sur and newer versions of macOS](mac-sysext-policies.md) and detailed in [installation instructions](#installation-instructions).

After you've enabled the service, you might need to configure your network or firewall to allow outbound connections between it and your endpoints.

### Licensing requirements

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Mac requires one of the following Microsoft Volume Licensing offers:

- Microsoft 365 E5
- Microsoft 365 E5 Security
- Microsoft 365 A5
- Windows 10 Enterprise E5
- Microsoft 365 Business Premium
- Windows 11 Enterprise E5
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint P2 (included in Microsoft 365 E5 and E5 Security)
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint P1 (included in [Microsoft 365 E3](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-plan-1-now-included-in-m365-e3/ba-p/3060639))

> [!NOTE]
> Eligible licensed users might use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on up to five concurrent devices.
> Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is also available for purchase from a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP). When purchased via a CSP, it doesn't require Microsoft Volume Licensing offers listed.

### Configuring Exclusions

When adding exclusions, be mindful of [common exclusion mistakes for Microsoft Defender Antivirus](common-exclusion-mistakes-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md).

### Network connections

Ensure that connectivity is possible from your devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint cloud services. To prepare your environment, please reference [STEP 1: Configure your network environment to ensure connectivity with Defender for Endpoint service](configure-environment.md).

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can connect through a proxy server by using the following methods:

- Proxy autoconfig (PAC)
- Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol (WPAD)
- Manual static proxy configuration

If a proxy or firewall is blocking anonymous traffic, make sure that anonymous traffic is permitted in the previously listed URLs.

> [!WARNING]
> Authenticated proxies aren't supported. Ensure that only PAC, WPAD, or a static proxy is being used.
> SSL inspection and intercepting proxies are also not supported for security reasons. Configure an exception for SSL inspection and your proxy server to directly pass through data from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on macOS to the relevant URLs without interception. Adding your interception certificate to the global store won't allow for interception.

#### Test network connectivity

To test that a connection isn't blocked, open `https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report` and `https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping` in a browser.

If you prefer the command line, you can also check the connection by running the following command in Terminal:

```bash
curl -w ' %{url_effective}\n' 'https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report' 'https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping'
```

The output from this command should be similar to the following:

 `OK https://x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/api/report`

 `OK https://cdn.x.cp.wd.microsoft.com/ping`

> [!CAUTION]
> We recommend that you keep [System Integrity Protection](https://support.apple.com/HT204899) (SIP) enabled on client devices. SIP is a built-in macOS security feature that prevents low-level tampering with the OS, and is enabled by default.

Once Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is installed, connectivity can be validated by running the following command in Terminal:

```bash
mdatp connectivity test
```
